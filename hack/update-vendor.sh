# 1. Move Origin's vendored deps into place as the baseline dependency tree.
# 2. Move Origin itself into place as a vendored dependency.
# 3. Delete any of Origin's vendored dependencies that conflict with ours.
# 4. Vendor our explicitly declared dependencies.
#
# The resulting tree should replace the current vendor directory.
