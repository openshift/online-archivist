# WARNING: this is an unfortunate hack to work past an issue that surfaced with vendoring.
# Without this the cluster monitor tests fail to compile after vendoring 3.6 with:
#   undefined: grpc.SupportPackageIsVersion4
# For some reason caused by importing: "github.com/openshift/origin/pkg/client/testclient"
# Using this explicit grpc version works past by correctly picking up a version of grpc
# that passes this compile check for etcd.
