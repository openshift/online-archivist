## Prerequisites

  * Configured GOPATH
  * $GOPATH/bin/ added to your PATH

## Compile and Run Locally

This method will run the archivist as whatever oc user is currently logged in.
This method is likely best used when you have run `oc cluster up` on a
workstation, logged in as system:admin, and want to run the archivist against
the projects in that local test cluster.

```
oc cluster up
oc login system:admin
```

Compile and run:

```
make build

# Run the cluster monitor component:
$ archivist monitor --config devel.cfg

# Run the archive REST API:
archivist archiver --config devel.cfg
```

Submit a request to the archive REST API:

```
$ curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST --data @transfer.json http://localhost:10000/api/transfer
```

## Integration Test Suite

The integration test suite currently assumes some kind of local test cluster, presumably oc cluster up, or
minishift. You must be logged in as "system:admin" with your local kubeconfig/oc client tooling, otherwise
the tests will immediately error out informing you why.

```
oc cluster up
oc login system:admin
make test-integration
```

These tests will create objects in the local test cluster, and generally should clean up after themselves.
