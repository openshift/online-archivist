// TestIntegration is the single entrypoint for integration tests. It uses Go
// subtests because the origin test scaffolding works in terms of a testing.T
// and we don't want to re-initialize the master and etcd instance with every
// individual test. So, create the harness just once and pass it to internal
// tests methods re-exposed as subtests. Remember to add any new tests to this
// list. Tests publicly exposed outside the subtest structure won't have access
// to the harness.
